          <P>Welcome to Volume 9 of The Rate of Change, hope your having a great week. Iâ€™m so glad to be back home finally and back to my normal schedule. I had an amazing time in Florida and SF but I feel so refreshed and happy to be back.</P>
          <P><strong>Great news:</strong> I was featured on my friendâ€™s creative talk show, called taâ€“lk, where I talk a bit about my story of becoming a designer and go into detail about my current work life. I talk about my projects with Quarry and what I work on at Satchel Health, as well as some general beliefs on the design world. <L hrefLink="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vTTJ-W-Axc">Check out the episode here</L> ðŸŽ‰</P>
          <P>As I promised, each of these will have a main blog post, and an update about my professional and personal life for this week. So before we get into this weekâ€™s article, hereâ€™s a quick update on my week.</P>
          <H size={2}>Side Projects - <L hrefLink="http://usequarry.com">usequarry.com</L></H>
          <P>Because I was on vacation, there isnâ€™t much to update you on here. Drew and I are still trucking away and designing and building Quarryâ€™s new site.</P>
          <P>Iâ€™ve been focusing on wrapping up the latest project for Quarry and have had to spend a lot of time researching and figuring out things in a field I am not 100% familiar with. Because of that, Iâ€™m taking my time and being very cautious about my approach to it. Anyways, Iâ€™ll keep you updated on that in the next couple weeks.</P>
          <H size={2}>Personal Life</H>
          <P>Just got back this week from an awesome 2 week vacation. I feel so much more refreshed and ready to get back into work as youâ€™ll read in this article.</P>
          <P>I took a couple pictures on my trip that I am going to share in a separate article on Medium and hopefully Exposure. These photos will also be available for free on <L hrefLink="https://unsplash.com/@cortes">my Unsplash</L> over the next few days if youâ€™re interested.</P>
          <P>After not taking on projects for a while, this week I decided to take on some new freelance gigs and am excited to see how these projects go. Iâ€™ll be sure to keep you updated and will be showing some progress over on my <L hrefLink="https://dribbble.com/fromcortes">Dribbble</L>.</P>
          <P>This weekâ€™s been pretty crazy with the election going on. No matter your candidate choice, I hope everyone stays safe and continues to spread love, positivity, and empathy throughout their lives. Letâ€™s push towards unity in this time of what feels like division.</P>

          <LineBreak />

          <P><DropCap>I</DropCap> just got back from a 2 week vacation a couple days ago. As you may know, this was my first vacation since going full-time and I was visiting some family in Florida, then spent a couple days in San Francisco. The very next day I got right back into my full-time work and I noticed something. I felt noticeably more motivated and inspired than I did before I left. It may seem obvious since I came back from a vacation, but this time was different. I thought about it and I realized why.</P>
          <P>Since I can remember, whenever I would take a vacation to visit family or go somewhere fun, I always spent a good chunk of the time there catching up on school or work tasks. As a full-time designer and student at the same time, I was always having to use my time wisely to stay up to par on what I had going on.</P>
          <P>This time, I had a <em>real</em> vacation. I worked a little bit on a couple personal projects while visiting family, but towards the end of the vacation, I <em>really</em> took the time to reset and reflect on my myself, my work, and my life.</P>
          <P>I was intentional about absorbing everything I saw around me and listening to my responses to what I saw and felt. I took time to pursue hobbies I usually donâ€™t have the time for like photography and reading. I met with new friends, ate great food, caught up on TV shows, climbed the hills of San Francisco, and walked for miles just taking everything in.</P>
          <P>The experiences were refreshing. I had a new and better perspective on topics in my personal and professional life. I came back feeling reset and refreshed. These past two weeks really gave me a better attitude towards taking breaks when needed and realizing the potential for improvement.</P>
          <P>My point is, I think a large amount of people get way too caught up in their work, myself included. We think working non-stop will get us some sort of appraisal. Periods of rest and reflection are just as important as periods of work, and we shouldnâ€™t have one without the other. Each should be approached with the same amount of passion to bring out the best in each.</P>
