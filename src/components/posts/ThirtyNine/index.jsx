          <P>Welcome to Volume 39 of The Rate of Change. I hope you‚Äôre having an amazing week. As I promised, each of these will have a main blog post, and an update about my professional and personal life for this week. So before I get into this week‚Äôs article, here‚Äôs a quick update on my week.</P>
          <H size={2}>Side Projects - <L hrefLink="http://usequarry.com">usequarry.com</L></H>
          <P>This week I launched Quarry‚Äôs new website! It‚Äôs been exactly one year after launching Quarry with my friend Drew, and it seemed only fitting to launch the site on the same day just a year later. I had a lot of fun thinking through the site and making it a simple but enjoyable site to learn more about us and our projects. I‚Äôll be adding a bit more to it over the next few weeks, but feels great to get it shipped and out in the wild. <L hrefLink="https://usequarry.com">Check out the site live here!</L></P>
          <P>Aaron and I have been making some great progress on Livtra this week and are in the depths of coding the first version of the app. We definitely have a lot of work to do before I can get the app in your hands, but I‚Äôm super pumped about where it is headed! Be sure to sign up for updates <L hrefLink="https://livtra.co">here!</L></P>
          <H size={2}>Personal Life</H>
          <P>This weekend I‚Äôm finally heading home after not seeing my family for almost 8 months. Excited to spend time with my family and some of my high school friends. I‚Äôll also be making sure to use any free time I have to work on Livtra but I‚Äôm excited to take it relatively easy and catch up with everyone back home.</P>
          <P>Although my progress will be broken with this upcoming trip üòÖ, this week marks a month of going to the gym every single weekday üí™.</P>

          <P><DropCap>J</DropCap><L hrefLink="https://medium.com/@jasonfried">ason Fried</L>, CEO of Basecamp, recently released an <L hrefLink="https://m.signalvnoise.com/if-youre-reading-this-you-probably-don-t-do-hard-work-41585c1c16a7">article</L> about hard work. First off, I recommend you go read that post. This post bring up a great point that I think about often, that the work we do is not hard work and most folks take this for granted. We can sit in an air conditioned room with just a laptop and an internet connection, drinking coffee, moving almost nothing but our hands. Jason goes into much more detail about this but what I want to focus on is the being grateful part.</P>
          <P>Up until I was four, I lived with my birth mother who had nothing. Some days I would go without eating and a Lunchable would be the greatest thing in the world for me, I still remember to this day almost 17 years later. Fortunately, I then moved in with my dad who was a doctor. My dad grew up with less than I could ever imagine and worked hard to get to the career he has. My dad always made sure my sister and I had everything we needed.</P>
          <P>All throughout my life though my dad always made it a point to teach me the value of work and money. Even though we lived comfortably, he taught me to never take that for granted, be grateful, and give back to others that needed things more than I did.</P>
          <P>Fast forward to now. I work from home doing web design and development, making great money for my age and have everything I need to live comfortably. I may ‚Äúwork hard‚Äù but I can guarantee the work I do isn‚Äôt <em>hard</em>. It did take years to learn and countless long nights, but I love doing it. It‚Äôs fun and rewarding. Challenging at times, yes, but never <em>hard</em>.</P>
          <P>Comparatively, I have quite the easy life, as do most of us in the tech and/or corporate world. I think it‚Äôs important to keep this in perspective and be grateful for the fortunate situation you have. You don‚Äôt have to work in fields farming in the hot sun for 8 hours a day. Most of your work can be done with a laptop and an internet connection.</P>
          <P>Be grateful for the situation you have, even if it‚Äôs not 100% where you want to be yet.</P>
